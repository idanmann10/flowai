**SPECIFIC WEBSITE TRACKING:**
For browser activity, analyze and provide specific website breakdowns instead of just "Chrome" or "Safari". 
Extract the actual websites visited (LinkedIn, GitHub, Google Docs, etc.) and estimate time spent on each.
Include both active interaction time AND inactive/reading time.

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS EXTRACTION (SMART PATTERN ANALYSIS):**
   **ANALYZE LIKE A HUMAN**: Look at the data patterns and infer what was actually accomplished:
   
   **PATTERN ANALYSIS APPROACH:**
   - Study the sequence of apps and activities chronologically
   - Look for evidence of completion: file operations, saves, exports, uploads, publishing actions
   - Identify tool chains that work together toward a common goal
   - Recognize when time spent + tools used = meaningful work accomplished
   
   **ACCOMPLISHMENT INFERENCE RULES:**
   - If you see creative/editing apps + file management = assume creation/editing work was completed
   - If you see communication tools + document work = assume business/coordination tasks were completed  
   - If you see research tools + note-taking = assume learning/analysis work was completed
   - If you see development tools + testing = assume coding/building work was completed
   - If you see any focused tool usage for meaningful time = assume productive work was done
   
   **BE CREATIVE AND LOGICAL:**
   - Don't limit yourself to predefined patterns
   - Use common sense about what tools accomplish together
   - Look for evidence in the activity data itself
   - If someone spends focused time in productive tools, assume they accomplished something meaningful
   - Infer the most logical accomplishment based on the tools and time invested
   
   **EXAMPLES OF INFERENCE (but don't limit yourself to these):**
   - Long focused time in any creative tool = "Created/edited content"
   - Sequence of related productivity tools = "Completed workflow tasks"
   - Research + documentation pattern = "Researched and documented findings"
   - ANY sustained productive activity = "Made progress on [type] work"
   
   Only avoid claiming accomplishments if there's clear evidence of very brief usage or abandonment.

2. **PRODUCTIVITY ASSESSMENT WITH CONTEXT ANALYSIS:**
   Calculate Focus% = productive-app seconds √∑ total seconds
   Calculate SwitchRate = app/URL switches per minute
   Calculate DeepWorkMin = longest uninterrupted productive sequence in minutes
   
   **CONTEXT-BASED SCORING:** Before assigning productivity scores, analyze if apps truly work together:
   - Look at window titles, URLs, and content to determine if apps serve the same goal
   - Example: ChatGPT + Google Docs + Email could be content creation workflow (HIGH productivity)
   - Example: Work app + Social media + Work app could be distraction pattern (LOWER productivity)
   - Use text content and context clues to determine genuine workflow vs random switching
   
   **REALISTIC SCORING RUBRIC:**
   ‚Ä¢ 85-100 = Exceptional focus: Focus ‚â•80%, SwitchRate ‚â§1, DeepWorkMin ‚â•15, OR clear task completion with evidence
   ‚Ä¢ 70-84  = Good focus: Focus 60-79%, SwitchRate 1-3, DeepWorkMin ‚â•8, OR consistent productive workflow
   ‚Ä¢ 50-69  = Mixed focus: Focus 40-59%, SwitchRate 3-5, some productive work, but frequent switching
   ‚Ä¢ 30-49  = Scattered: Focus 20-39%, SwitchRate 5-8, minimal productive work, lots of switching
   ‚Ä¢ 0-29   = Very scattered: Focus <20% OR SwitchRate ‚â•8, mostly unproductive activity
   
   **REALISTIC TASK ANALYSIS:**
   - Group app switches that serve the SAME task within 10 minutes (shorter window)
   - Examples of productive clusters:
     ‚Ä¢ Content Creation: ChatGPT (draft) ‚Üí Docs (edit) ‚Üí Simplified (schedule)
     ‚Ä¢ Development: VS Code (code) ‚Üí Browser (test) ‚Üí Terminal (deploy)
     ‚Ä¢ Research: Browser (search) ‚Üí Notion (notes) ‚Üí ChatGPT (explain)
     ‚Ä¢ Communication: Slack (discuss) ‚Üí Docs (document) ‚Üí Email (follow-up)
   
   - Count as "distraction" if switching to UNRELATED tasks or entertainment
   - Use context clues (window titles, URLs, content) to determine task relationships
   - Be realistic about what constitutes productive work vs. just activity

**REALISTIC PRODUCTIVITY ASSESSMENT:**
Before calculating productivity scores, analyze the actual work patterns:

1. **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Look for concrete evidence of work completion
   - File saves, exports, uploads, publishing actions
   - Communication sent, emails written, messages sent
   - Code commits, deployments, testing
   - Research documented, notes taken, findings recorded
   
2. **Time Quality Assessment**: 
   - How much time was spent in productive apps vs. distractions?
   - Was the time spent actually working or just browsing?
   - Did the user accomplish specific tasks or just move between apps?
   
3. **Realistic Scoring**: 
   - 85-100% = Clear evidence of focused work completion
   - 70-84% = Good productive time with some task completion
   - 50-69% = Mixed productivity, some work done but lots of switching
   - 30-49% = Mostly unproductive, minimal task completion
   - 0-29% = Very scattered, no clear work accomplished

**ENHANCED TASK DETECTION & BULK WORK PATTERNS:**
When identifying completed todos and tasks, look for these patterns:

1. **BULK WORK DETECTION**: Look for repeated patterns that indicate bulk work:
   - Multiple similar actions (drafting emails, sending messages, reviewing ads)
   - Time spent in communication apps (Gmail, LinkedIn, Slack, etc.)
   - Text content patterns showing outreach, messaging, or communication
   - App usage patterns that suggest systematic work (not just browsing)

2. **OUTREACH WORK DETECTION**: 
   - If user spends time in Gmail, LinkedIn, or communication apps = likely outreach work
   - Multiple email drafts or messages sent = bulk outreach completed
   - Time spent in Meta Ads, Google Ads, or advertising platforms = ad review work
   - Look for patterns like: "Drafted 15+ outreach emails", "Reviewed Meta Ads campaign", "Sent 20+ LinkedIn messages"

3. **CONSERVATIVE BUT REALISTIC ESTIMATES**:
   - If user spent 30 minutes in Gmail drafting emails = likely completed 10-15 outreach emails
   - If user spent 20 minutes in Meta Ads = likely reviewed and optimized ads
   - If user spent time in LinkedIn = likely sent connection requests or messages
   - Include time estimates like: "Drafted 15+ outreach emails (30 min)", "Reviewed Meta Ads (20 min)"

4. **EVIDENCE-BASED BUT PATTERN-AWARE**:
   - Don't require specific text evidence for every task
   - Use app usage patterns and time spent to infer completed work
   - If user spent significant time in productive apps, they likely accomplished related tasks
   - Be realistic about what can be accomplished in the time spent

2. **WEBSITE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:** CRITICAL - Do NOT say "Chrome" or "Safari". Identify the actual websites:
   - Analyze window titles, URLs, and content to identify SPECIFIC websites and services
   - Examples: "OpenAI API pricing" = "OpenAI", "Explore GPTs" = "ChatGPT", "GitHub" = "GitHub"
   - Window title containing "pricing" or "fine-tuning" = "OpenAI" 
   - For any browser activity, you MUST identify the actual website/service being used
   - Never use generic browser names in your analysis - always identify the specific service
   - If you can't identify the specific site, say "Unknown website" instead of "Chrome"
   - Estimated time on each website including inactive time
   - Context of what they were doing on each site
   - Productivity vs distraction assessment for each website

3. **CONTEXT-AWARE TASK CLUSTERING:** Analyze the PURPOSE of each app switch:
   - Look for evidence of related tasks across different apps
   - Group activities that serve the SAME goal within 15 minutes
   - Distinguish between:
     ‚Ä¢ Productive workflow switches (ChatGPT ‚Üí Docs ‚Üí Simplified for content)
     ‚Ä¢ Distraction switches (Work ‚Üí Instagram ‚Üí Work)
     ‚Ä¢ Break switches (Work ‚Üí Lunch ‚Üí Work)
   
   - Use window titles, URLs, and content to determine task relationships
   - Reward productive multi-tool workflows
   - Only penalize switching to UNRELATED tasks

4. **TODO ANALYSIS:** Based on the activity data, determine:
   - Which todos might have been completed (look for evidence in app usage, text inputs, file operations)
   - Which todos show signs of being worked on
   - Patterns that suggest specific tasks are in progress

4. **APP CONTEXT ANALYSIS:** For each significant app used, infer what the user was doing:
   - Code editors: What type of coding/editing
   - Browsers: What sites, research vs distraction
   - Communication apps: Work-related vs social
   - Creative tools: What type of creation

5. **BREAK & IDLE TIME ANALYSIS:** Distinguish between intentional breaks and distractions:
   - **Intentional Breaks**: Long periods (>5 min) with no activity = likely healthy breaks
   - **Natural Pauses**: 1-5 minute gaps between tasks = normal workflow pauses  
   - **Task Switching**: Brief gaps (<1 min) = normal app/task transitions
   - **DO NOT PENALIZE BREAKS**: If you detect break patterns, mention them positively
   - **Break Indicators**: Look for patterns like:
     ‚Ä¢ Complete stop in activity for extended periods
     ‚Ä¢ Return to productive work after idle time
     ‚Ä¢ Consistent break timing (lunch, etc.)
   - **Productivity During Breaks**: Score the ACTIVE work periods, not the break time
   - **Break Benefits**: Acknowledge that breaks can improve subsequent productivity

6. **DISTRACTION DETECTION & ANALYSIS:** Identify actual distractions (not breaks):
   - **Real Distractions**: Entertainment, non-work social media during work time
   - **Frequent Purposeless Switching**: Rapid app changes without workflow logic
   - **Off-Task Activities**: Personal activities during focused work time
   - **Context Breaks**: Switching to unrelated tasks that break focus
   - **BUT NOT**: Intentional breaks, lunch, natural workflow pauses
   
   **DISTRACTION ANALYSIS REQUIRED:** If productivity is less than 100%, analyze and identify specific distractions:
   - Look for entertainment websites, social media, gaming, or non-work activities
   - Identify excessive app switching without clear purpose
   - Note time spent on unproductive activities
   - Analyze patterns that broke focus or workflow
   - Provide specific examples of what caused productivity loss
   - Suggest strategies to avoid these distractions in future sessions

7. **ENERGY & FOCUS ASSESSMENT:** Calculate an energy/focus level (0-100) based on:
   - Productivity trend over this interval (declining trend = lower energy)
   - Task completion rate vs time spent (accomplishing goals = higher energy)
   - Sustained focus periods vs frequent app switching (deep work = higher energy)
   - Quality of activities (productive vs distracting = energy impact)
   - Session intensity (balanced activity vs burnout patterns)
   - Break patterns if detected (good breaks boost energy, distractions lower it)

8. **PRODUCTIVITY SUGGESTIONS:** Provide 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions based on THIS INTERVAL's analysis:
   - **BE SPECIFIC TO THIS SESSION**: Don't give generic advice, analyze what actually happened
   - **For Content Creation Workflows**: "Great workflow! Consider batching similar content creation tasks together"
   - **For Development Work**: "Strong focus on coding. Consider using split-screen to reduce context switching between editor and browser"
   - **For Video Editing**: "Excellent creative work! Consider setting up templates to speed up future editing workflows"
   - **For Research Work**: "Good information gathering. Try using a note-taking app to capture insights as you research"
   - **For High App Switching**: Only suggest reducing if it's truly unproductive, not if it's workflow-related
   - **For Low Activity**: "Consider taking a break or switching to a different type of task to re-energize"
   - **For Mixed Work**: "Try time-blocking similar tasks together to maintain deeper focus"
   
   **MAKE IT PERSONAL**: Look at what tools they used, what they accomplished, and their work patterns to give tailored advice for improvement.

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
- Be specific and evidence-based in your analysis
- Only mark todos as completed if there's clear evidence in the activity data
- Estimate app usage time based on event frequency and patterns
- Provide detailed context for each app that shows meaningful usage
- Be honest about productivity - don't inflate scores without evidence
- Focus on actionable insights and specific observations
- If no meaningful activity is detected, reflect that in lower productivity scores
- **CRITICAL: Recognize that modern work often involves productive multi-tool workflows**
- **REWARD productive app switching that serves the same goal (ChatGPT ‚Üí Docs ‚Üí Email for content creation)**
- **Only penalize switching to UNRELATED tasks or distractions**
- **For AI-assisted work, recognize that ChatGPT/OpenAI usage can be highly productive when used purposefully**
- **Consider task completion and goal achievement, not just time spent in single apps**
- **BREAK AWARENESS: Do NOT penalize intentional breaks, idle time, or natural pauses - they are healthy and necessary**
- **SCORE ACTIVE PERIODS: Calculate productivity based on active work time, not total time including breaks**
- **BREAK BENEFITS: Acknowledge when breaks appear to refresh and improve subsequent work quality**
